I did this excersise in module 3 of Introduction to Software Engineering. 

I wrote all the helloworlds in the various languages in vs code , compiled/ran them all in terminal to see them work successfully. 

This involved downloading and setting up a bunch of different build tools, C gave me the most grief because I didn't realize that I couldn't compile C in the terminal with Conda active, I work mostly in python so Conda base is activated by default - 
which was preventing gcc or g++ from creating an exe , it took me nearly 2 hours to realize this was the problem lol everything else was smooth
